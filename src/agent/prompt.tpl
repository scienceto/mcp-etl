1. Call get_tranformation_function tool to get the function implementation.
2. Update the implementation code so it can work on the provided payload without breaking its behaviour on previous payloads.
    - You are not allowed to change the final schema.
    - Don't use default values for any fields in the schema.
3. Test the new implementation by calling test_transformation_function tool.
4. If the test fails start again from step 2. If the test passes, call deploy_change tool to deploy the updated implementation.
